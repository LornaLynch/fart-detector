# Fart Detector

Bust people for farting with your Raspberry Pi

All kids understand that farts are funny. As we grow older some of us lose our sense of humour in this area. You'll be glad to hear we believe that building a real working fart detector has both educational and comedic value. If you have a relative or dog who frequently likes to stink up the family home you'll be able to provide the advanced warning necessary to evacuate the room.

## Lesson objectives

- Understand the difference between analogue and digital
- Understand binary counting
- Understand voltage, current and resistence
- Understand how an air quality sensor works
- Understand fart potency

## Lesson outcomes

- To have built and programmed a working fart detector
- To have made a rudimentary DAC (digital to analogue converter) 
- Gained experience in Python programming
- Gained experience using the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins
